# lib/oauth.sh — engine-agnostic OAuth orchestration
#
# Owns the user-facing flow: "is auth needed? / show what's about to
# happen / preserve-state skip / verify after". Hands off to the
# active engine's `engine_auth_setup` for the actual interactive
# token-capture work — *that's* where engine-specific knowledge lives
# (which CLI to invoke, how to parse the captured token, which env
# var name persists into systemd's EnvironmentFile, etc.).
#
# 3.4.3 split this in two: this file is the orchestrator; the engine
# adapter at lib/engines/<id>.sh does the actual auth.
#
# Layout constants (CREDS_FILE) come from lib/layout.sh.
# `engine_auth_check` and `engine_auth_setup` come from the active
# engine adapter, sourced via lib/engine.sh.
#
# Exposes:
#   oauth_setup    — idempotent: skip if authed, else run engine_auth_setup + verify
