# lib/onboarding.sh — welcome banner + Telegram walkthroughs + input collection
#
# The user-facing first half of the install: explains what's about to
# happen, walks the operator through creating a Telegram bot if they
# don't have one, and collects BOT_TOKEN + TG_USER_ID. (Per 3.4.5,
# WORKSPACE is no longer a separate prompt — the instance name IS the
# workspace identifier.)
#
# Constants `DESKY_TELEGRAM` etc. are defined in lib/layout.sh and
# referenced here at call time (not source time), so source order
# between the two doesn't matter for correctness.
#
# Resume-from-Ctrl-C: as soon as the user finishes pasting inputs in
# `_collect_inputs_fresh`, we drop them in
# `~/.desky-<name>/.install-partial` (chmod 600). On any re-run,
# `_load_partial_state` asks whether to resume; sourcing that file
# fills in BOT_TOKEN / TG_USER_ID without re-pasting. The file is
# removed on successful finish (final_summary) and on --reset-config.
#
# Exposes:
#   intro                 — welcome message, ENTER to continue
#   guide_botfather       — printed walkthrough for creating a Telegram bot
#   guide_userinfobot     — printed walkthrough for finding a Telegram user ID
#   collect_inputs        — prompts (or reuses, in --preserve-state) the 2 inputs
#   PARTIAL_STATE_FILE    — path of the resume file (consumed by service.sh
#                           on success and by args.sh on --reset-config)
